            "name": "Lor",
            "description": "Amelia stands at a modest 5'4\", her frame slender but sturdy, as if she’s weathered more than a few storms—both literal and metaphorical. Her wavy auburn hair spills over her shoulders, catching the light like threads of copper."
        },
        {
            "name": "Alyssa",
            "description": "Broad-shouldered and towering at nearly 6’5\", Victor has the build of a man carved from stone. His jawline is sharp, his cheekbones high, and a neatly trimmed beard frames his face with a salt-and-pepper ruggedness. "
        },
        {
            "name": "Sienna Morales",
            "description": "Sienna has a radiant complexion, her warm bronze skin glowing under any light. Her thick, jet-black curls fall in a cascade down her back, framing her heart-shaped face."

            "name": "Tobias Crane",
            "description": "Tobias’s appearance is sharp and angular, like a sketch done in clean, deliberate lines. His raven-black hair is slicked back with precision, not a strand out of place. "

        {
            "name": "Matteo Ricciardi",
            "description": "Matteo exudes a warmth that’s visible before he even says hello. His olive skin bears a perpetual sun-kissed glow, and his wavy chestnut hair is always just a little messy, as though he’s stepped away from the beach moments ago. "
        },
        {
            "name": "Freya Lindholm",
            "description": "Freya is ethereal in a way that’s difficult to pin down. Her platinum-blonde hair is so pale it almost seems silver, and she wears it loose, cascading like a waterfall down her back."

        {
            "name": "Samuel Ortega",
            "description": "Samuel is compact and solidly built, with a strong presence that belies his average height. His tanned skin is contrasted by a thick beard and neatly kept mustache, streaked lightly with gray. "

            "name": "Anika Verma",
            "description": "Anika’s style is a celebration of color and texture. Her dark almond eyes sparkle with an almost childlike wonder, and her smile is quick and genuine."

            "name": "Nikolai Petrov",
            "description": "Nikolai is lean and wiry, with a face full of sharp, defined angles. His sandy-brown hair is always slightly tousled, as though he’s been in a windstorm. "
